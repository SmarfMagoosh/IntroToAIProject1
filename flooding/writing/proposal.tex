\section{The Problem}
\par The problem is to solve the ``Flood-it'' game (https://unixpapa.com/floodit/). The game is played as follows
\begin{itemize}
    \item The goal is to get the whole board to be one color in the minimum number of moves
    \item You perform a ``move'' by selecting a color.
    \item When you select a color $c$, the top left vertex $v$ is recolored to $c$, and all vertices adjacent to $v$ of the same color are merged into $v$. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Instance Generation}
\par We will get instances of the problem by randomly generating a 2D grid of integers representing colors. We will then algorithmically convert that 2D grid into a graph as an instance.

\section{Algorithms}
\par Our first algorithm that we will implement is A* with heuristics such as total nodes in the graph after recoloring, and degree of the ``Blob Node''. Our other algorithm will be Beam-Stack Search with similar heuristics.

\section{Experimentation}
\par For experimentation we will vary the total number of nodes and the number of colors.

\section{Performance Metrics}
\par Percent of instances where it found a solution in under 5 minutes, number of nodes explored, and percent of instances it can solve in a fixed amount of memory.
